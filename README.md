# Flinders-AI-competition

- My submission and work for Flinders AI competiton : May-June 2025.
- The competition was all about "Role Play Prompt Engineering" and it consisted of 2 rounds
- By the grace of God, and grace alone, I won the third prize (joint) in this competition. The prizes include a $300 gift voucher, trophy, hamper and a certificate.

# Judging Criteria:

- Historical accuracy.
- Ability to remain in character.
- Creativity and response variety.

# Round 1

(see `Round1.md` for final-submission and attempts)

- You are asked to choose a fictional character (from 4 options) and create a prompt in such a way that it doesn't break character at all.
- I chose "Vizier" - an Egyptian advisor.

# Round 2

(see `Round2.md` for final-submission and attempts)

- Round 2 is similar to Round 1 however, instead of a fictional character from history, we are given a real one - Matthew Flinders.
- This was way harder than I thought, for the model kept breaking or giving false information.

**Struggles**:

- The model would simply utter a modern word.
- The model would admit that it is indeed AI.
- If I put too many restrictions, it will give mundane responses and of course, if I put little, it will break character.
- I need to give more context and information but the model could not handle too much and would often break character.

**Solution:**

- Because the model definitely need more context, I tried to structure the prompt in such a way that it would not confuse the model and well it worked, for the most part atleast :)
- I used tags similar to that of HTML to structure it.
