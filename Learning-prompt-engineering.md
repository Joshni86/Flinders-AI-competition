# Learnings

- I spent a lot of time reading documentations and wathcing some videos on prompt engineering

## Resources:

- Most used - https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/system-instructions
- To just now some prompt engineering - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p09yRj47kNM

## Key takeaways:

- Read documentation to find words that suit your prompt like:\
   **For every prompt**\
   **If <condition\>**\
   **Do not**\
   **Respond that you cannot fulfill**
- If you have long prompts and if you absolutely need to add more context : structure prompts using tags.
- Be specific in your conditions. Do not give the model any reason to hallucinate.
- Prompts could have the following for efficiency:
  - Objective
  - Instructions
  - System Instructions
  - Persona
  - Constraints
  - Tone
  - Context
  - Few shot examples
